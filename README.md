# ArahEmu

ArahEmu is a project that aims to emulate parts of the Guild Wars 2 servers. The goal is not to reimplement all the features and content of the original game, but to rather create a modding platform for the community.

The project is open source, and anyone can contribute by forking the repositories and creating pull requests.
